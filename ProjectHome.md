This is a demonstration fps using the Panda 3D game engine. The ultimate goal is to create a 'complete' game - Panda 3D suffers from having lots of little demo games, which fail to sell Panda 3D to newbies or provide guidance on building a complete game. As a secondary goal it would act as a framework for people intending to make fps-s (Or other genres - the system is very flexible.).

At this point the project is mostly stalled, due to a lack of free time from the contributors - it is hopped that this will be fixed, both due to current contributors finding the time and new contributors.

In its current state a playable environment exists, with all the key components of a fps, except for enemies. (You can still shoot cans of spam however!) Key things it demonstrates are how to handle levels in a game, use of a plugin architecture and a few examples of fx. Polish is lacking however, and most of the artwork is of the programmer variety.


Major items of work that need doing include:
  * Combat system - health, weapons, hud, environmental damage.
  * AI & enemies. (AI ultimately as a generic system committed directly into Panda?)
  * Rigorous lighting system (Current approach isn't correct.) - deferred shading should be considered.
  * FX, inc. proper particle system (Pandas one is awful.), post processing effects etc.
  * Levels!
